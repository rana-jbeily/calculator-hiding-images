Explanation
Calculator Function (calculate):
This function takes three parameters: two numbers and an operation.
It performs the specified arithmetic operation and returns the result.
Image Hiding Function (hide_image):
This function takes the path to an image file.
It reads the image file, encodes it using base64, and returns the encoded string.
The encoded string can be embedded directly into an HTML <img> tag.
Flask Web Application:
The script uses Flask to create a simple web application with two routes:
/calculator: A form to perform basic arithmetic operations.
/hide_image: A form to hide an image using base64 encoding.
HTML Templates:
The render_template_string function is used to render HTML templates directly from strings.
The calculator form allows users to input two numbers and select an operation.
The image hiding form allows users to input the path to an image file.
Running the Script
Install Flask:
shCopy
pip install flask
Run the Script:
shCopy
python script_name.py
Access the Web Application:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/calculator for the calculator.
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/hide_image for the image hiding functionality.
This script provides a basic example of how to perform calculations and hide images using Python and Flask. You can expand it further based on your requirements!
